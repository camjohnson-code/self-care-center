### Context:

[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was an assigned solo project during week 3 at Turing School of Software and Design. The goal was to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while creating a simple and interactive application. I spent around 6 hours to get the features you see in it's current state.

### Contributors:

[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
This project was solo developed by me! Check out my GitHub [here](https://github.com/camjohnson-code).

### Learning Goals:

[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- Practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Gain experience in DOM manipulation and the Data Model.
- Implement basic user interactions.

### Wins + Challenges:

[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

#### Wins:

- Successful implementation of random message generation.
- Creation of a favorites feature with toggle functionality.
- Adding functionality for localStorage.

#### Challenges:

- I initially struggled with the functionality of the favorite button. I overcame by carefully managing data structures and toggling favorite status.
- Utilizing localStorage was something I have not been exposed to prior to this project. It took a tiny bit of self-teaching and a big chunk of help from my mentor to understand and implement it into this application.

### Looking Ahead:

Moving forward, I'd like to add the following features:

- User can add their own message
- User can delete a message
- User can delete a favorite
- User never sees a repeated message
- Login Page
- Mobile responsiveness
